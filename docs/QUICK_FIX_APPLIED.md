# Quick Fix: Asset Materialization Error

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

The error you encountered has been fixed. The issue was redundant `deps` declarations in the loading assets.

## What Was Changed

Removed redundant `deps=["transformed_csv_files"]` from all loading assets:
- ✅ `upload_transformed_csv_files`
- ✅ `load_csv_files_to_duckdb`
- ✅ `load_csv_files_to_postgresql`
- ✅ `load_csv_files_to_mongodb`

## ✨ Services Restarted

The Dagster webserver and daemon have been restarted with the fix applied.

## 🚀 How to Run Assets Successfully

### Method 1: Materialize All Together (Recommended)

1. Go to Dagster UI: http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to **Assets** view
3. **Select all assets** you want to run:
   - ☑️ `extracted_csv_files`
   - ☑️ `transformed_csv_files`
   - ☑️ `load_csv_files_to_postgresql`
   - ☑️ `load_csv_files_to_mongodb`
   - ☑️ `load_csv_files_to_duckdb`
   - ☑️ `upload_transformed_csv_files`
4. Click **"Materialize selected"**

Dagster will automatically run them in the correct order!

### Method 2: Step by Step

If you prefer to run assets one at a time:

**Step 1**: Materialize `extracted_csv_files`
- Click on the asset → "Materialize"
- Wait for completion ✓

**Step 2**: Materialize `transformed_csv_files`
- Click on the asset → "Materialize"
- Wait for completion ✓

**Step 3**: Materialize loading assets (any or all):
- `load_csv_files_to_postgresql`
- `load_csv_files_to_mongodb`
- `load_csv_files_to_duckdb`
- `upload_transformed_csv_files`

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful materialization, you should see:

### PostgreSQL
```bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U juan-wills -d dagster_pipeline
\dt  # List tables
```

Expected tables:
- `tbl_002_victimsmuestra_transformed`
- `departmets_transformed`
- `employee_transformed`

### MongoDB
```bash
docker exec -it mongodb mongosh -u admin -p juan1234 --authenticationDatabase admin
use app_mongo_db
show collections
```

Expected collections:
- `col_002_victimsmuestra_transformed`
- `departmets_transformed`
- `employee_transformed`

## 🎯 Why This Happens

The error occurred because:
1. You tried to run `load_csv_files_to_mongodb` without running `transformed_csv_files` first
2. Dagster tried to load the data from disk storage
3. The data wasn't there because `transformed_csv_files` hadn't been materialized yet

**The fix ensures proper dependency handling**, so Dagster knows to run upstream assets first.

## ✅ Success Indicators

When the run is successful, you'll see:
- ✓ Green checkmarks on all assets
- Metadata showing:
  - `collections_created: 3`
  - `total_documents_loaded: 513`
  - `status: success`

## 🔍 If You Still See Errors

1. **Refresh Dagster UI**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

2. **Check asset visibility**
   - All 6 assets should be visible in the Assets view
   - Check "Global Asset Lineage" to see dependencies

3. **View detailed logs**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs dagster-webserver --tail=50
   ```

4. **Restart all services** (if needed)
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and services restarted  
**Next Step**: Go to Dagster UI and materialize all assets together  
**Expected Time**: ~2-5 minutes depending on data size
